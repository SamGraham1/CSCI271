* Assignment 2 for CSCI 271-001 Spring 2026
*
* Author: Sam Graham
* OS: Windows 11
* Compiler: javac 25.0.1
* Date: January 29, 2026
*
* Purpose
* The purpose of this program is to design a data structure that that 
*offers exact arithmetics calcuations. We need to avoid float number 
*division by keeping the values as fractions, 
*which means that we need several operations to implement the data type 
*and implement the operations needed to perform the desired arithmetic manipulations.
