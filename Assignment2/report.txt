CSCI 271 – Assignment 2

Purpose:
The goal of this assignment was to create a Fraction data type that allows exact arithmetic calculations without using floating-point numbers.
This ensures accurate results for operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, negation, and exponentiation.

Class Design:
The Fraction class stores fractions using a numerator and a denominator, both as long integers. The constructors automatically reduce fractions
by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD) and make sure the denominator is positive. Special cases like
Infinity, -Infinity, and NaN are handled when the denominator is zero. All arithmetic methods return new Fraction objects, leaving the original 
fractions unchanged.

Test Cases and Results:
The main method includes a thorough set of test cases to verify the class works correctly:

Constructors and normalization: Fraction(6, -24) = -1/4, Fraction(0, 8) = 0, Fraction(7) = 7

Special cases with toString(): Fraction(23, 0) = Infinity, Fraction(-6, 0) = -Infinity, Fraction(0, 0) = NaN, Fraction(7, 1) = 7

Arithmetic operations: 1/3 + 1/6 = 1/2, 3/4 - 1/4 = 1/2, 2/3 * 3/4 = 1/2, 2/3 / 4/5 = 5/6

Negation: negate(5/7) = -5/7, negate(Infinity) = -Infinity, negate(NaN) = NaN

Exponentiation: (2/3)^2 = 4/9, (5/9)^0 = 1, (1/3)^-3 = 27

Full example from the assignment: c.multiply(a.divide(b)) = 240/133

All test cases returned the expected results, showing the class handles both normal and edge cases correctly.

Conclusion:
The Fraction class works as intended, performing exact arithmetic with proper normalization and handling special cases. It meets all the requirements
of the assignment and provides a reliable way to work with fractions in Java.
