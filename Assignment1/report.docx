1. Program Purpose and Structure

The program calculates a student’s final numeric grade using assignment scores, test scores, a midterm, and a final exam. 
It uses Java’s main() method, Scanner for input, loops to collect scores, and variables to store averages and weighted values. 
The program can accept either manual input or redirected input from a file for testing.

2. Core Logic and Calculations

Assignment and test averages are calculated first, then combined with midterm and final exam scores using weighted formulas. 
Conditional logic determines how the final grade is calculated based on test performance, ensuring that stronger test scores result 
in higher weighted outcomes while weaker test scores limit assignment impact.

3. Bug Awareness and Testing

A logical bug occurred when input validation used || instead of &&, causing invalid scores to be accepted. 
This was fixed by correctly checking that values fall between 0 and 100. The program was tested using command-line input redirection 
to verify correctness and consistent output. Also the sum of the weights already represents the percentage so dividing by 70 scales E incorrectly.
